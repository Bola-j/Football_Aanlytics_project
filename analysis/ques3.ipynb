    "# Analysis Plan: Do Teams with Higher Average Player Age Perform Worse?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "Investigate whether teams with higher average player age show worse performance in tournaments using PCA and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Loading & Initial Exploration\n",
    "- Import libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)\n",
    "- Load player statistics CSV from FBref scraping\n",
    "- Examine structure with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`\n",
    "- Check for missing values and data types\n",
    "- Identify available columns: Player, Team, Position, Age, Goals, Assists, Minutes, Matches Played, Games Started, xG, npxG, xAG, Progressive Carries, Progressive Passes, Cards, League, Country\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Cleaning\n",
    "- Remove rows with missing critical values (Age, Team)\n",
    "- Convert numeric columns from strings to appropriate types\n",
    "- Handle missing values in performance metrics\n",
    "- Validate data quality before analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Age Parsing\n",
    "- Parse age format \"YY-DDD\" (years-days) to extract years only\n",
    "- Create new `Age_Years` column with integer values\n",
    "- Validate parsing with descriptive statistics\n",
    "- Visualize age distribution by league\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Team-Level Performance Aggregation\n",
    "- **Group players by Team and League**\n",
    "- Calculate team average age (mean across all players)\n",
    "- Aggregate performance metrics per team:\n",
    "  - Total goals, assists, xG, npxG, xAG\n",
    "  - Total progressive carries and passes\n",
    "  - Total yellow/red cards\n",
    "  - Squad size and average matches per player\n",
    "- Create normalized per-match metrics for fair comparison:\n",
    "  - Goals per match, Assists per match\n",
    "  - xG per match, xAG per match\n",
    "  - Progressive actions per match\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Feature Standardization\n",
    "- Select 6-8 key performance metrics for PCA\n",
    "- Apply `StandardScaler` to ensure mean=0, std=1\n",
    "- Prevents variables with larger scales from dominating PCA\n",
    "- Validate scaling worked correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: PCA Application (Core Technique)\n",
    "- Fit PCA to standardized performance metrics\n",
    "- Create **scree plot** to visualize variance explained by each component\n",
    "- Determine optimal number of components (typically 2-3 for 80-95% variance)\n",
    "- Analyze **component loadings** to interpret what each PC represents:\n",
    "  - PC1 might represent \"overall attacking output\"\n",
    "  - PC2 might represent \"playing style\" (direct vs progressive)\n",
    "- Transform team data into principal component scores\n",
    "- Visualize teams in PC1-PC2 space, colored by average age\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Correlation Analysis (Age vs Performance)\n",
    "- **Primary research objective:** Test relationship between team age and performance\n",
    "- Calculate Pearson correlation (linear relationships)\n",
    "- Calculate Spearman correlation (monotonic relationships)\n",
    "- Test correlations for:\n",
    "  - Age vs individual metrics (goals, xG, assists, etc.)\n",
    "  - Age vs principal component scores (PC1, PC2)\n",
    "- Extract p-values for significance testing (α = 0.05)\n",
    "- Create summary table showing all correlations with significance markers\n",
    "- Visualize scatter plots with regression lines for key metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Age Group Comparison\n",
    "- Categorize teams into age groups:\n",
    "  - Young teams (< 25 years average)\n",
    "  - Middle-aged teams (25-27 years)\n",
    "  - Older teams (> 27 years)\n",
    "- Compare performance distributions using box plots\n",
    "- Run statistical tests:\n",
    "  - **ANOVA** (if normally distributed)\n",
    "  - **Kruskal-Wallis** (non-parametric alternative)\n",
    "- Perform post-hoc pairwise comparisons to identify which groups differ\n",
    "- Test differences in PC scores across age groups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: K-Means Clustering (Optional Advanced Analysis)\n",
    "- Apply clustering on PCA-transformed data (2D space)\n",
    "- Use **elbow method** to find optimal number of clusters (k=2-5)\n",
    "- Calculate **silhouette scores** to validate cluster quality\n",
    "- Analyze average age within each performance cluster\n",
    "- Test if age differs significantly across clusters using ANOVA\n",
    "- Interpretation: Do high-performing teams tend to be younger/older?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10: Comprehensive Visualizations\n",
    "Create 6-8 key visualizations:\n",
    "1. **Scree plot** - variance explained by each PC\n",
    "2. **PCA biplot** - teams in PC1-PC2 space, colored by age\n",
    "3. **Component loadings** - which metrics contribute to each PC\n",
    "4. **Age distribution** - histogram and league comparison\n",
    "5. **Correlation heatmap** - age vs all performance metrics\n",
    "6. **Scatter plots** - age vs key metrics (goals, xG) with regression lines\n",
    "7. **Box plots** - age group performance comparison\n",
    "8. **Cluster visualization** - if clustering applied\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 11: Statistical Summary & Conclusions\n",
    "- Synthesize all findings into clear statements\n",
    "- Answer research question with statistical evidence:\n",
    "  - \"Teams with higher average age show **[positive/negative/no]** correlation with performance\"\n",
    "  - Report correlation coefficients and p-values\n",
    "  - Identify which specific metrics are affected\n",
    "- Discuss **limitations**:\n",
    "  - Observational data (no causation)\n",
    "  - Confounding factors (league quality, budget, injuries)\n",
    "  - Missing variables (tactics, coach experience)\n",
    "- Provide data-driven conclusions with confidence levels\n",
    "- Suggest future research directions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Performance Metrics\n",
    "Based on FBref standard stats table:\n",
    "- **Attacking:** Goals, Assists, xG (Expected Goals), npxG (non-penalty xG), xAG (Expected Assists)\n",
    "- **Playing Style:** Progressive Carries, Progressive Passes\n",
    "- **Discipline:** Yellow Cards, Red Cards\n",
    "- **Participation:** Minutes, Matches Played, Games Started\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Shooting stats (Shots, Shots on Target) and passing completion are NOT available in this dataset and would require separate scraping from FBref shooting/passing pages."
